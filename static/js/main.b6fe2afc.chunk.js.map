It is a 20 over format of playing cricket introduced in 2003 as a need for a shorter version of the game to counter the falling attendance of spectators. Currently, it is the 6th most attended league globally, and the world’s most attended league as of 2016. `,\n            `The participating franchises form their teams by conducting an auction before the tournament from a pool of national and international cricket players of different countries. The auction starts with the ‘marquee’ list, where 16 players in two batches of eight each come up for bidding. The marquee lot is followed by capped and uncapped players: batsmen, all-rounders, wicket-keepers, fast bowlers and spinners. After the players have been presented for bidding, the accelerated process will enable franchises to nominate a set number of players from the remaining ones. The list is submitted on the first day, and the nominated players go up for bidding the next day. Once these players have been presented, the franchises will be asked to submit their wish list from the complete list of players. Those unsold will come up for auction after all the players have been called once. The list of unsold players, however, is drawn up subject to the franchises’ request.`,\n            `As per the new IPL player policy, each franchise can spend a maximum of INR 80 crore (USD 12.5m) on their squad salaries. The new rules also dictate that franchises spend 75% of the salary cap, which amounts to INR 60 crore (USD 9.4m approx.). The player retention rules stipulate that a team can retain a maximum of five players through a combination of pre-auction retention and Right-To-Match (RTM). A franchise can retain a maximum of three capped India players and two capped overseas players. Having each retained three players, Super Kings, Daredevils, Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers have only two RTMs remaining. The other four franchises have three RTMs, each having retained no more than two players.`,\n            `In order to predict the price of a batsman, there are several important parameters to consider. Runs are an essential parameter that tells us the best performance a player will give, which decides the player’s popularity among fans. The batting average is the total number of runs a batsman has scored divided by the number of times they have been out, which tells us how consistent a batsman is, which is essential because the team must score within ten wickets, of which not all are specialized in batting. A batting strike rate is a measure of how frequently a batsman achieves the primary goal of batting, namely scoring runs, which is important because the speed at which the runs are scored is critical in high-scoring games. Balls faced is the number of balls that the batsman has played in the entire season. The batsman can bat in the first inning or the second inning, decided by the captain of the toss-winning team. Price is the output of our model.`,\n            `In order to predict the price of a bowler, there are several important parameters to consider. Runs are an essential parameter that tells us how many runs a bowler has given in the past. The lesser runs he/she gives, the better the bowler. Bowling average is the ratio of runs conceded per wickets taken, meaning that the bowling average is, the better the bowler is performing, which tells us how much the bowler will allow the opponent to make runs. A lesser number of runs is preferred. Bowling strike rate is the balls bowled by wickets taken, which tells how quickly a bowler can take wickets. The economy runs per over, which tells if the bowler can bowl with lesser runs given. Balls bowled is the number of balls that the bowler has played in the entire season. The bowler can ball in the first inning or the second inning, decided by the captain of the toss-winning team. Price is the output of our model.`,\n            `At present, choosing to bid for a player is done by eight people from each team. Each member has different expertise and contributes to the final decision-making, making it challenging to make decisions. Furthermore, pressure situations and hurried decisions which need to be made at the auction can lead to costly mistakes. The proposed model makes the decision-making more accurate, fast and less prone to errors. We can predict the price of a player based on his past performance.`,\n            `Another problem that the present method suffers from is that opponents are often aware of the team’s favourite player due to regional popularity. This knowledge has often been abused by the opponents to inflate the price of the desired players. Our model helps the bidder realize that the range of the price the player is expected to be sold at, making them aware of the same to adjust their budget plans.`,\n            `Thirdly, the accuracy with which auctioneers can evaluate a player is dependent on their experience in evaluating players, which is also being taken care of by our model by using player historical performance to predict the cost.`,\n            `In this work, we have shown how we can use neural networks and K-Means or Hierarchical clustering in place of clustering algorithms to represent data in a meaningful way to predict the best batsman/bowler to be sent next for a given match condition at an Indian Premier League Cricket Match.

We carried out tests using various neural networks ranging from single-layered perceptron to multilayered multi-neuron neural networks, along with a variety of data representations. The neural network with three hidden layers perceptron gave the best results for batsman and bowlers, respectively. These neural networks can produce fast and accurate results within 3 seconds.

The team manager has to deal with target score, innings, wickets, over, ball, batsman (on strike), the batsman (not on strike) and the bowler bowling the over. The team will have to bat in one inning and bowl in the other inning, which is the captain of the toss winning team decides. The IPL match consists of 20 overs with six balls in each over. An over must be played in its entirety by a single bowler. The target score is the minimum score that the team should have made, in a particular ball of an over, to make the team likely win the match. Wickets are defined as the number of batsmen who have become out. A batter who has become out cannot bat for the rest of the match. At any given ball, there must be two batsmen on the pitch. A batter who has become out must be replaced.`,\n            `In an IPL match, from the batting team manager's perspective, after one of his/her batsmen has become out, he/she must send another batsman to replace the one who has become out. The choice must be made in such a way that the batting team wins. To do so, the team manager has to choose a replacement batsman such that the batsman can perform well with the given match conditions. The match conditions that affect the batsman's performance include target score, innings, wickets, over, ball, the batsman (not out) and the bowler.`,\n            `Similarly, from the bowling team manager's perspective, after each over, he/she must decide which bowler to send next. At the end of each over, the bowling/fielding team's manager must send a bowler such that the bowling/fielding team wins. To do so, the team manager has to choose a bowler for the next over such that the bowler can either make it hard for the opposing team's batsmen to score or make them 'out' within the given match conditions. The match conditions that affect the bowler's performance include target score, innings, wickets, over, ball, the batsman (on strike) and the batsman (not on strike).`,\n            `We have attempted to solve these problems. Firstly, the decision to bid for a player is made by eight people from each team. Each member has different expertise and makes equal contributions to the final decision-making, making it challenging to make unanimous decisions. Furthermore, pressure situations and hurried decisions which need to be made at the auction can lead to costly mistakes. The proposed model makes the decision-making more accurate, fast and less prone to errors.`,\n            `Another part of this problem is that the present method suffers from is that opponents are often aware of the team's favourite player due to regional popularity. The opponents have often abused this knowledge to inflate the price of the desired players. At present, the accuracy with which auctioneers can evaluate a player depends on their experience in evaluating the eight members of the bidding team.`,\n            `Secondly, from the team manager's perspective, sending the batsman/bowler is done by either the team captain or the team manager. Team captains are often the ones to decide which batsman/bowler to send because they are always present near/on the field to make quick decisions. Their decisions are prone to errors due to their reliance on intuition and sentimental issues from playing in the cricket match. Team managers, who would be ideal for making independent decisions, are often not consulted because they do not have enough time to compare the match parameters with the previous match data. Their decisions are also prone to errors.`,\n            `A player, who has not performed well or has not been given enough opportunities, might miss out on some opportunities that were better suited for him/her.`,\n            `The first problem can be solved using a neural network to train a neural network with the player performance parameters & cluster numbers of the players and the price at which the player was sold for in the previous year.`,\n            `The second problem can be solved using two neural networks to train the model for every ball that has been played in the past. By doing so, our network will accurately predict which batsman/bowler to send next.`,\n            `We have used machine learning, a branch of computer science, to train the machine based on past data to predict future outcomes. Our problem is related to classification because it involves classifying which cluster number the batsman/bowler needs to belong to, given the match parameters. Artificial Neural Networks(ANNs) are composed of many highly interconnected processing elements (neurons) working in a multilayered structure that receives inputs, processes inputs, and produces an output. We used ANNs because they are tolerant to data quality issues and neither need normalization nor require independence assumptions. Furthermore, they provide faster and more accurate results when compared to other machine learning techniques.`,\n            `We have used SoftMax and ReLu activation function. SoftMax is an activation function that uses x number of real numbered inputs and outputs a probabilistic value that is ideal in deciding which decision is when the output neural network has more than two neurons. ReLu is an activation function that outputs the positive real number if positive else outputs 0.`,\n            `We have used the K-Means clustering technique, which can be used on well-separated data. The algorithm starts with random initial centroids with computation of the Euclidean distance from each data point. The closest centroid is the cluster to which a data point is marked. The centroids are then computed using the mean of all the data points belonging to it. This process is continued till the centroids change. Hierarchical clustering starts with each data point as a cluster and then merging the closest ones into one cluster. This cluster is then chosen as a data point, and the parent cluster is formed using it and the other points. This process is continued till the required numbers of clusters are obtained. The final result will be a dendrogram.`,\n            `This work predicted the cost at which a player can be sold in the Indian Premier League Auction using machine learning-based algorithms. We estimated the players' selling price using their past performance parameters like runs, balls, innings, wickets and matches played. Tests were carried out in various machine learning models like Decision Tree Regressor, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression, Stochastic Logistic Regression, Random Forest Regressor and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Among these, SVR and Linear Regression gave the best results for predicting batsman and bowlers, respectively. These algorithms can produce fast and accurate results within 3 seconds, helping auctioneers make quick decisions.

To keep the same swift check for solutions, we utilized the mathematical lower limit of given clues and ensured our options never exceeded that number.`,\n            `We have chosen difficulties within the constraint previously discussed according to the number of possible combinations in the grid, excluding the givens changing. The fewer givens there are, the more potential combinations there are, and therefore, the harder to find the combination that works with the three rules of Sudoku. When setting the difficulty level, it is vital to ensure that the Sudoku generated will be well-formed.`,\n            `Worldwide, Sudokus have gained much popularity due to annual Sudoku Championships being organized in locations where there is the scope of growth in the Professional Sudoku solvers community. Due to this rapid growth of Sudoku popularity, there has been a growth in demand for Sudoku generating and solving software. The programing problem is an NP-Complete.

At present, setting up of hospitals is done in a localized manner. Macroscopic influences over number of patients visiting hospitals is not considered. When a hospital is having too many patients in an area, newer hospitals are set-up in order to accomodate for the healthcare requirement. This approach works with seasonal factors affecting spread of diseases. However, in a pandemic, spread of disease does not always follow the same pattern. The current medical health system is at risk of being overburdened by patients if the number of cases was to spike uncontrollably. To prepare ourselves for the worst- case scenario, the right decisions must be made quickly when upgrading the medical infrastructure of the country.`,\n            `In a pandemic, in some places the number of are much higher than others.

This could rapidly change the number of patients that a hospital expects. This could be as a con- sequence of the early opening up of businesses or lack of preventive action. Therefore, there is a need for software that will determine which is the optimal place to set-up a hospital from a list of suitable sites. It is necessary that the software will rely on the latest data so that action can be taken as suited.
